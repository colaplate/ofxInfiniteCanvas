#ofxInfiniteCanvas
Infinitely zoomable and scrollable 2D canvas addon for openFrameworks.


###Usage
It is really simple to use, quite much as ofEasyCam.

You can also change the lookAt position so this will emulate the left, right, top, bottom, front and back orthographic projections like in 3D CAD software.

Check the examples.

###Compatibility
Developed using the current head from github, but should work with older versions.

###Notes

This addon used to be called ofx2DCam. I changed the name as this is more catchy :) as well as it reflects better the idea of the addon.
If you have ofx2DCam addon installed, remove it and install this one, as it will not be updated any longer.
